     * Alternative level:
     * 
     * $x		Attribute: rule arguments, return values, predefined rule prop.
     * AttributeDict: references to tokens and token labels in the
     * current alt (including any elements within subrules contained
     * in that outermost alt). x can be rule with scope or a global scope.
     * List label: x is a token/rule list label.
     * $x.y	Attribute: x is surrounding rule, rule/token/label ref
     * $s::y	Attribute: s is any rule with scope or global scope; y is prop within
